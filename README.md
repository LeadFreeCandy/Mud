# Introduction

-   **Project Name:** Mud

-   **Team Members:** Samir, Joyal

# Overall Vision

Mud is a modern C-like programming language that offers simplicity,
performance, and advanced features like zero cost abstraction,
concurrency, and a powerful type system. It is a great language for
teaching programming basics in a modern environment. Our complete
project will be a fully fledged and bootstrapped compiler that can
reliably and efficently compile Mud to a variety of targets.

# Milestones:

1.  **Week 4**

    1.  Outline the design goals of the language

    2.  Have a concrete definition of syntax

    3.  Implement a prototype lexer and parser

2.  **Week 8**

    1.  Implement a C transpiler written in rust

    2.  Create documentation that covers the basic functionality of the
        language

    3.  Possibly bootstrap the compiler here

3.  **Week 12**

    1.  Implement a LLVM backed compiler

    2.  definitely bootstrap the compiler here
